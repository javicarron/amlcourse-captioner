# amlcourse-captioner
A Neural Network to perform automatic captioning of images.

This is based on the final project of the course "Introduction to Deep Learning", first course of the "Advanced Machine Learning Specialization" on Coursera: https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml

This notebook is a reimplementation of the exercise using Tensorflow 2.4 instead of Tensorflow 1. 

At the end of the notebook, there is a good number of commented examples and remarks.

For any question, please feel free to open an issue.
